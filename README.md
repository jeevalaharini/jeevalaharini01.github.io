**PROCESS INVOLVED IN THE AIRLINE PASSENGER SATISFACTION ANALYSIS**

### 1. **Define Objectives and KPIs**
   - Identify the primary goals, such as improving on-time performance, reducing complaint rates, or enhancing overall customer experience.
   - Establish Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), like  Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), and on-time arrival percentages, to measure success.

### 2. **Data Collection**
   - **Internal Data Sources**: Collect data from ticket sales, customer feedback forms, loyalty programs, and in-flight service records.
   - **External Data Sources**: Use external sources like social media sentiment, online reviews, and industry benchmarks to capture broader customer perspectives.
   - **Operational Data**: Collect data on flight schedules, delays, staffing, and baggage handling to understand operational impact on satisfaction.

### 3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Address missing, inconsistent, or duplicate data to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
   - Standardize data formats and remove any outliers that could skew the analysis.

### 4. **Data Integration**
   - Integrate diverse datasets from multiple systems (e.g. feedback databases, flight operations) into a centralized platform or data warehouse.
   - Ensure that data privacy and compliance standards, such as GDPR, are maintained throughout this process.

### 5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Perform exploratory analysis to uncover initial patterns, trends, and outliers in passenger satisfaction.
   - Visualize the data to identify correlations, seasonal trends, or anomalies affecting satisfaction levels.
     

### 6. **Data Modeling**
   - Apply predictive analytics and machine learning models to predict factors affecting passenger satisfaction, like delay likelihood or the need for additional staff on high-traffic flights.
   - Segment passengers based on preferences, demographics, and behaviors to create targeted insights.

### 7. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Use natural language processing (NLP) on customer feedback and social media comments to gauge overall sentiment and identify common issues.
   - Categorize comments to reveal areas of improvement (e.g., delays, service quality, baggage handling).

### 8. **Data Visualization and Reporting**
   - Develop dashboards and reports that summarize key findings and make the data accessible to decision-makers.
   - Use real-time reporting tools to track KPIs and provide actionable insights on the go.

### 9. **Implement Recommendations**
   - Based on insights, recommend actionable steps like revising flight schedules, increasing onboard amenities, or adjusting loyalty programs to boost satisfaction.
   - Collaborate with departments to execute improvements and ensure data-driven recommendations are acted upon.

### 10. **Monitor and Refine**
   - Continuously monitor KPIs to assess the impact of changes.
   - Collect post-implementation feedback and refine data models and processes to improve future analysis.
